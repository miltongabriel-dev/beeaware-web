<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<p>
BeeAware (“the App”) is designed with privacy by default. We do not require user
accounts, names, email addresses, or any form of direct personal identification
to use the App.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
BeeAware collects only the minimum information necessary to operate as a
community safety awareness tool.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Community reports:</strong> Safety-related information submitted
    voluntarily by users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Approximate location data:</strong> Location associated with reported
    incidents, limited to what is necessary to display incidents on the map.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anonymous technical metadata:</strong> Limited technical information
    (such as timestamps or anonymized identifiers) used to prevent abuse,
    ensure system integrity, and support moderation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>

<p>
Collected information is used solely to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Display safety-related incidents on the map;</li>
  <li>Improve situational awareness for users;</li>
  <li>Prevent misuse, spam, or abusive behavior;</li>
  <li>Maintain the reliability and security of the service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
BeeAware does <strong>not</strong> sell personal data and does not share personal
information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
</p>

<p>
Community reports may become visible to other users after moderation delays
or automated checks. Publicly available official data sources may also be
displayed alongside community reports.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>
Community reports and related data may be stored for a limited period to support
safety awareness, moderation, and system integrity. Data may be removed,
aggregated, or anonymized over time.
</p>

<h2>Emergency Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
BeeAware is not an emergency service. The App does not monitor incidents in real time.
Always contact local emergency services if you are in immediate danger.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<p>
As BeeAware does not collect direct personal identifiers, most data cannot be
linked back to an individual user. Where applicable under data protection laws,
you may contact us with questions or concerns regarding privacy.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after
changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
